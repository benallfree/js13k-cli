## JS13K Starers

Scaffold a new js13k project from curated starter projects.

### Quick start

```bash
npm create js13k@latest
```

### What it does

- Lists available templates from the JS13K repo's `examples/` directory
- Prompts you to pick one and a target directory
- Clones just that example subfolder via `tiged`
- Detects a lockfile and suggests the install command (defaults to `bun install`)

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a new starter kit or improvements to existing ones:

- Fork the repo and add your template under `examples/<your-starter>`
- Ensure it builds and runs out of the box
- Open a PR describing the starter and any notable features
