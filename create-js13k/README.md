## JS13K Starers

Scaffold a new js13k project from curated starter projects.

### Quick start

```bash
npm create js13k@latest
```

### What it does

- Lists available templates from the JS13K repo's `examples/` directory
- Prompts you to pick one and a target directory
- Clones just that example subfolder via `tiged`
- Detects a lockfile and suggests the install command (defaults to `bun install`)
